# RecLafti

A lightweight shader graph compiler for [vvvv](https://vvvv.org).

Future plans involve getting some funtionality to [VL](https://vvvv.org/documentation/vl/).

Based on [FeralTic](https://github.com/mrvux/FeralTic) and [vvvv-dx11](https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv) by [Julien Vulliet](https://github.com/mrvux)
